# LeNetHWAccelerator
Design and implement a hardware accelerator for LeNet Inference CNN structure in SV, following the Data-flow architecture.

# Introduction
Yann LeCun, Leon Bottou, Yosuha Bengio and Patrick Haffner proposed a neural network architecture for handwritten and machine-printed character recognition in 1990â€™s which they called LeNet-5.
